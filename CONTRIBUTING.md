### Getting Started
We have made some resources and guides to help you through the process of contributing to the website. Here they are:
- [Passenger Showcase Guide](http://thecodingtrain.com/guides/passenger-showcase-guides)
- [Maintaining The Website](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/maintain-website-guide)
- [Content Structure Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/blob/main/content/pages/guides/content-structure-guide.md)
- [README](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/README.md)

### Issues

If you are about to create a new issue, search if an issue already exists regarding the same problem. If a related issue doesn't exist, go ahead and open an issue describing the problem. An issue could be about a bug that you discovered, a suggested change or even a discussion.

To find an issue that you want to fix, scan through the list. You may find that the `labels` are helpful in this situation. You can use them as a filter as well while searching.

### Making Changes

- To make changes to this repository, make sure to fork it and make changes to your fork locally, without harming the original project.
- It is good practice to create a different branch for different changes.
- Commit the changes your are making at every step, and make sure to add good commit messages describing the part you added/changed with that specific commit.
- When you are happy with your changes and are ready to publish them, make a pull request. We will review your suggested changes and hopefully merge them!

### Development Environment

Make sure you have Node.js version `16.x` as well as npm installed. You can find how to test your changes locally [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com#development-info).
