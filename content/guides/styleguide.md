# Styleguide for video descriptions, naming conventions, which videos should link to what content, etc... 

*This isn't a strict set of rules, I just needed a place to keep track of what choices I'd made for different types of content.*

## Videos

Titles: Short and simple! Stay as close to original (YouTube) video title as possible, remove playlist numbering, category (e.g. "p5.js Tutorial"), replace "and" with "&", capitalize every word unless it's a function/variable name
Languages: Library > Language (eg. "p5.js, JavaScript", not "JavaScript, p5.js")
Topics: Theme > Concept > Skill Level (still not 100%, but "Loops, Beginner" not "Beginner, Loops")

## Tracks

Main tracks are series of videos which (more or less) follow a linear progression and cover a specific skill or framework. Side tracks focus on a general theme, and can incorporate videos from all over the site. 

## Links

If linking to a video/playlist on TheCodingTrain channel, don't include author name?
Avoid linking to code examples

## Code Examples



## Contributions

Contributions are enabled if there are existing contributions on the old site or if the topic allows for a range of creative expression. A video like "Shapes & Drawing" would allow contributions, for example, while "p5.js Web Editor" would not.
