# Styleguide for video descriptions, naming conventions, which videos should link to what content, etc... This isn't a strict set of rules, I just needed a place to keep track of what choices I'd made for different types of content. 

## Videos

Language tag: Library > Language (eg. "p5.js, JavaScript")

## Tracks

Main tracks are series of videos which (more or less) follow a linear progression and cover a specific skill or framework. Side tracks focus on a general theme, and can incorporate videos from all over the site. 

## Links

Links for videos 

## Contributions

Contributions are enabled if there are existing contributions on the old site or if the topic allows for a range of creative expression. A video like "Shapes & Drawing" would allow contributions, for example, while "p5.js Web Editor" would not.
