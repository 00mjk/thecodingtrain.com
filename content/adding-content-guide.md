# Adding content guide

### Last update: December 3rd 2021

On december 3rd 2021 there was an agreement to start adding real content to this project as a way to understand how the workflow feels and if the developing structure may benefit of changes or tweaks.

With that in mind, the purpose of this guide is to show how to add content to the new Coding Train website being develop.
